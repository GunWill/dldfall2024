hash function maps a message --> from input to output, making sure the recieved messgae is the sent message 
way to authenticate
hash function recieves, checks message is correct, unlocks like a key if correct message 

collissian resistance vital

path must be unique 

SHA-256 // 256 bits
//goal here is to design a SHA-256 that outputs 256 bits with is padded to 512 bits

hash function can generate digests of messages, and we can use digests to detect if message has been altered since being sent


digital summaries of data that are produced by a hash function, such as SHA.


To run a program, go to the command prompt and type: python3
ascii.py


Python is an interpreted language and needs an interpreter which is called
python3 to run any program


Bit swizzling has two functions in SV
– Concatenation (putting two vectors together)
– Replication (repeating items within a vector or bit)

rotation is just moving values to left or right by some amount




The 512-bit message is processed at 32-bit blocks called the Merkle-Damgård
construction labeled W0 through W63 for the prepare block
