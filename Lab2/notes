hash function maps a message --> from input to output, making sure the recieved messgae is the sent message 
way to authenticate
hash function recieves, checks message is correct, unlocks like a key if correct message 

collissian resistance vital

path must be unique 

SHA-256 // 256 bits
//goal here is to design a SHA-256 that outputs 256 bits with is padded to 512 bits

hash function can generate digests of messages, and we can use digests to detect if message has been altered since being sent


digital summaries of data that are produced by a hash function, such as SHA.


To run a program, go to the command prompt and type: python3
ascii.py


Python is an interpreted language and needs an interpreter which is called
python3 to run any program


Bit swizzling has two functions in SV
– Concatenation (putting two vectors together)
– Replication (repeating items within a vector or bit)

rotation 

shifting is just moving values to left or right by some amount




The 512-bit message is processed at 32-bit blocks called the Merkle-Damgård
construction labeled W0 through W63 for the prepare block







64 bits for length
ascii is 8 bits each 

8 bytes for length
512 bits total 
if message 447 no padding
1 bit indicates hte end of the message 

message, 1 bit, then 64 bits for lenght 


elf if a program 



sha 256

message is just stored as 1 and 0 in a file 

sha - 256 256 bits padded to 512, processed in groups of 32 bits


secure hash algortith

send hash and mesage nad compare that its the same

sha generate a unique number 


sha hardware 

rotating 



shifting 

to right divides by 2, to left multiplies by 2


messes up message 

encriptrion // gives fingerprint 

encriptin // decription // brute force // 


length of how many tiems it meses up cards


sha creates fingerprint



password checks if message matches


can never go back to message from sha 256



how is ip address unique to my computer // 128 bits // hard codded into my computer // mac address 

VPN // just hides the data im acessing


//possible to encript 

// ping from different towers

//python3 sha256.py
cat sha256.py




bit swizzling {} 

adding



try w/ 5 different messages 

compare hash i should have to hash i do have


//use modelsim and file 

//optimization
