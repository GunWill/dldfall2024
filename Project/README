For the sha256 design, there are multiple ways to verify that the 5 tests work. The fastest way is to look at the sha256.out file, which is formated: 

golden || hashed || message

Additionally, the Modelsim transcript will display tests passed: Test passed for message: message.

The waveform also has the hashed, golden vector, and message waves displayed for visual verification. 

There were 5 tests done, 5 tests passed. 

There are 2 videos included with the report (one in the report as a link and one will be submitted alongside the report and sha256 files);
one gives an overview of the design and one gives an overview of the implementation. 

The code used "posedge" but the clock was inverted, so that flip flop values will update on the falling edge of the clock.
